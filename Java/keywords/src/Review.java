    /* Primitive Types:
    char, - any multiplication will return a bit num, to concatenate you must use an
    empty string

    byte,short,int,long - defaults to int, anything else must be type declared
    float,double - defaults to double, must type declare float

    you can type cast as long as it's in the range of the smaller typing
    either (data type) or is letter after the num ex. (byte) 190b;


    Each comes with a Wrapper class that is the full name + a .
    Can change the primitives using this

    Non-Primitive:
    String ( denoted with a capital letter)


    And &&,
    Or ||

    If {
    }else if{
    }else{}



    Methods:
    3 main goals :
    Reusability
    Reduce Code duplication
    Achieve different Results

    to declare a method
    Must use all parameters set

    public static void methodName(parameters) - for non returns
    public static datatype methodName(parameters){
        return;
    } - for a returning set of data
    ***must be the type of the returning data***
